Project 1 - Chat

This program was tested to work on Flip3.

1. Choose the port to run the server on. Then run the command "python chatserve.py [port]" to start the server.

2. From another connection (to Flip3) type make to create the clients executable.

3. Next run "./chatclient [server-addr] [port-on-server]" to connect to the python ChatServer.

4. Now that the communication is open, the client and server can take turns sending messages to eachother.

5. Type "\quit" on either end to close the clients connection.

6. Use Ctrl-C on the Server to shut it down.

**Important**
Client MUST make first contact with the server.
